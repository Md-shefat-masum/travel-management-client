The first settlement started 250 years ago, in 18th century, by Arabian merchants who named the island 'Jazira'. During British occupation the island was named after the then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong Mr. Martin as St. Martin Island. Likely because one or more of the Arabs were Saint and whose name could not be identified. Local names of the island are Narikel jinjira[3] which means 'Coconut Island', and Daruchini Dwip which means Cinnamon island. It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.",
